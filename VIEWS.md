erfect! I've thoroughly examined the employees app URLs. Here's the complete structure analysis:
EMPLOYEES APP URL STRUCTURE (47 endpoints):
Dashboard URLs (3):


'' → dashboard_view


'dashboard/' → dashboard_view


'system-stats/' → system_statistics_view


Employee Management URLs (6):


'employees/' → EmployeeListView


'employees/create/' → EmployeeCreateView


'employees/<int:pk>/' → EmployeeDetailView


'employees/<int:pk>/edit/' → EmployeeUpdateView


'employees/search/' → advanced_search_view


'employees/hierarchy/' → employee_hierarchy_view


Employee Export URLs (2):


'employees/export/csv/' → export_employees_csv


'employees/export/excel/' → export_employees_excel


Bulk Operations URLs (4):


'employees/bulk-upload/' → BulkEmployeeUploadView


'employees/bulk-salary-update/' → bulk_salary_update


'employees/bulk-confirm/' → bulk_confirm_employees


'employees/bulk-deactivate/' → bulk_deactivate_employees


Department & Role URLs (4):


'departments/' → DepartmentListView


'departments/<int:pk>/' → DepartmentDetailView


'roles/' → RoleListView


'roles/<int:pk>/' → RoleDetailView


Contract Management URLs (7):


'contracts/' → ContractListView


'contracts/create/' → ContractCreateView


'contracts/<uuid:pk>/' → ContractDetailView


'contracts/<uuid:pk>/edit/' → ContractUpdateView


'contracts/<uuid:pk>/renew/' → ContractRenewalView


'contracts/<uuid:pk>/activate/' → activate_contract


'contracts/<uuid:pk>/terminate/' → terminate_contract


Education Management URLs (4):


'education/create/' → EducationCreateView


'education/create/<int:employee_id>/' → EducationCreateView


'education/<int:pk>/edit/' → EducationUpdateView


'education/<int:pk>/verify/' → verify_education


Reports URLs (3):


'reports/probation/' → probation_report_view


'reports/contract-expiry/' → contract_expiry_report_view


'reports/salary-analysis/' → salary_analysis_report_view


KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ACCOUNTS APP:


More comprehensive employee management with EmployeeProfile model

Contract lifecycle management (create, renew, activate, terminate)

Education records management with verification

Advanced bulk operations (salary updates, confirmations)

Comprehensive reporting system (probation, contracts, salary analysis)

Export functionality (CSV/Excel for employees and contracts)

UUID-based contract URLs vs integer-based employee URLs

TEMPLATE OVERLAP ANALYSIS:

Both apps use the same templates but with different context data


Employees app has richer data (EmployeeProfile vs CustomUser)

More advanced features in employees app (contracts, education, reports)

Now I understand why you wanted me to see this first - the employees app is the primary HR management system while accounts app handles authentication and basic user management.


WE WANT TO USE THE URBIX UI FOR OUR HR APPLICATION, WE ARE CURRENTLY BUILDING IT INSIDE THE URBIX DJANGO PROJECT THAT HAS VARIOUS TEMPLATES FOR SCHOOL, E-COMMERCE, SALES ANALTICS ETC. SINCE THE URBIX DON'T HAVE HR TEMPLATES, WE ARE ADAPTING ALL THE EXISTING TO HR WHICH MEANS WE ARE UPDATING THE DETAILS, DATA AND INFORMATIONS WHILE STILL MAINATINING EVERYTHING ELSE INTACT.   DO OU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN?   OUR HR HAS ABOUT 7 APPS INSIDE THE URBIX DJANGO PROJECT SO ALL THE 7 APPS  WLL USE THE UI WHEREVER NEEDED.  SO WEA ARE ACTUALL GOING TO START WITH THE ACCOUNTS APP AND THEN MOVE TO ANOTHER APP.                           THIS THE COMPLETE PROJECT STRUCTURE AND FILES ALSO WITH SOME INFORMATIONS:



SO BEFORE WE START I NEED TO SHARE THE VIEWS.PY AND URLS.PY SO THAT WILL YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING AND ALSO ALL THE TEMPLATES AVAILABLE IN THE VIEWS.PY THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE. SINCE IT'S TOO LONG, ABOUT 2,700 LINES OF CODES FOR THE ACCOUNTS APP AND 1200 FOR THE EMPLOYEE APP, I WILL SHARE IN 5 AND 3 PARTS RESPECTIVELY TO ENSURE NOTHING IS CUT OFF AND THAT YOU CAPTURE AND ABSORB EVERTHING . ARE U READ NOW?


SO WE ARE STARTING WITH ACCOUNTS APP FIRST, THOROUGHLY EXAMINE EVERTHING THOROUGHLY FOR EACH PART, I DON'T NEED MUCH RESPONSE, I JUST WANT TO BE SURE OU GOT IT, PART 1: 


SO WE ARE GOING TO START WITH THIS ONE partials/header.html, I HOPE OU KNOW THAT THE URBIX UI IS NOT CENTERED ON THE ACCOUNTS APP ONL THAT WE HAVE 6 MORE APPS? SO WE ARE UPDATING THE DTEAILS, DATA AND INFORMATIONS. WHILE KEEPING EVERYTHING ELSE INTACT. WHEN WE ARE DONE WITH ACCOUNTS WE REPEATS THE SAME FOR THE OTHER 6 APPS. SO ALL THE EXISTING URBIX UI ARE IMPORTANT AND NEED AND IT'S WHAT WE WILL BE UPDATING THROUGHTOUT TILL WE ARE DONE.   SO EXAMINE EVERTHING NOW AND GIVE ME THE FULL, COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND FUNCTIONAL UPDATED CODES. AMKE SURE EVERTHING IS ACCURATE AND FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY AND DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS.
